## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

We designed ZaZaQuest to be enjoyed without compromising your privacy. Our App does **not** collect, transmit, store, or share any personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") about you.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Your name, email address, phone number, or physical address.
* Your device's unique identifiers (e.g., IDFA, Android Advertising ID).
* Your precise or approximate location data.
* Any data about how you use the app (analytics, usage patterns).
* Information from your device's contacts, photos, microphone, camera, or calendar.
* Any payment or financial information.

## 2. Information Storage

Since we do not collect any Personal Data, we do not store any such data. Any data related to your app usage (like game progress or settings, if applicable) is stored **only locally on your own device** and is not accessible to us. If you delete the app, this local data is typically deleted as well.

## 3. Information Sharing

Because we do not collect any Personal Data, we do not share any Personal Data with third parties.

## 4. Children's Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect Personal Data from anyone, including children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age threshold in other jurisdictions). If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child may have provided us with information (which should not be possible through the App), please contact us immediately using the contact information below.

## 5. Third-Party Services

ZaZaQuest does not use third-party services (like analytics or advertising networks) that collect Personal Data from users through our App.
